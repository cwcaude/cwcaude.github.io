# Note
This series of posts is not made as strictly a *tutorial* While I will be explaining how things work and giving instruction on iOS tweak development, the purpose of this posting is to **explain** and **document** my journey/path of learning to develop iOS tweaks. If you desire for strictly a tutorial in iOS Tweak Development check out these links here :

# Recapping my Release
So in just two short weeks of learning iOS Tweak Development I successfully released my first tweak. Albeit a very non-complicated tweak, I am hoping to add more functionality to this. Aside from the previous post in which I gave the link to my repo I also made a release post on the [r/Jailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jailbreak) subreddit. The link to that post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/hsew6p/free_release_messageswap_customize_the_title_bar/). I had a pretty successful release and got some good feedback on the tweak!

# What now?
Well my purpose with this tweak has been to learn more techniques and methods used in developing tweaks. So with that I will add more functionality to the tweak. And hopefully take some reccomendations/requests I got in my Reddit posts to add this functionality. I also want to make an icon for the tweak to show in the settings app.
